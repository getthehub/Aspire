    <h1> The Perfect Dancer Is You </h1>
    <p> More then you relaize, many of our favorite models and dancers aren't as perfect as they seem. </p>  
    <p> Did you know that the average age of retirement for a dancer is, around thier early to late 30's years of age. Dancer don't have a very long carier, concluding in them starting at a very young age and pushing their abilities to the limit.</p>
    <p> Dancers can develop a very serios disease called anorexia a lack or loss of appetite for food (as a medical condition/ an emotional disorder characterized by an obsessive desire to lose weight by refusing to eat. Most dancers devolp anorexia after the media, showing a definiton of what a dancer should look like. Extremly slim with little weight just to keep the size of the "perfect dancer".This is not just a major problem that usually occurs with ballet dancer but  ith all dancer and even models. Some dance teachers also provoke anorexia or similair behavior. Anorexia can lead to starvation or even worse death. Thankfully most dancers avoid the popular media belief and stay strong and healthy. <br> In addition not everyone is as slim as a stick, some people tend to have more weight then others but that is completly okay. We are all different if we were all the media dancers then no one would be able to challenge the popular belief and make history. </p>

<h1> How dancers have overcome this problem </h1>
<p> If we work together we can change the way society works not just for ballet dancers but for all girls,here is a quote from a dancer who fought the media to be herself. "But these values have led many dancers to feel that their bodies are under scrutiny from teachers, choreographers and audiences. In their minds, their worth is determined by how they look. Burdened with short, stressful careers, seldom compensated properly, they fall into the belief that their lives are outside their control. This belief can lead them to obsessive behavior of every stripe. We must also acknowledge that the average dance patron probably does not approve of his or her own body and goes to dance performances to dream of some harmonious, charming, region populated only by people who meet the physical ideal."</p>
<p> Sometimes were not strog enpought to fight the media by ourselves here is a quote from a dancer that overcame anorexia. "Little did I know the damage I was doing to myself both physically and mentally. Thankfully, upon noticing my significant weight loss and obscure eating habits, my parents and dance teachers intervened before I was able to cause my body any detrimental damage." </p>
